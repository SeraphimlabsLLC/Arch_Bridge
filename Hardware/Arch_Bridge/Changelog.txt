
Rev 06:
Decreased F2 250mA fuse, making it same as F1.
R9 is now 33 ohm 2w, voltage drops below 7v triggering limiting/disconnect before F2 blows.
Previous design would have blown fuse above 12v before railsync devices disconnected. 

Relabel TTY to CONSOLE. 
Changed pinout to match Crystal board: +5v, TX, RX, GND. 
Added status LED on TX. 

Relabel I2C to COM2. 
Changed pinout: +5v, TX, RX, GND.
Added status LED on TX. 
Connected OE to processor OE output. 

PCB revision to incorporate these changes.

Rev 06A: 
Changed CB1 to through hole for field installation. Removed from default bom and populate.

Rev 11:
Found R15 would overheat if >12v was used.
Changed R14 and R15 to be 2512 SMD resistors for 1w heat capacity, allowing vin up to 24v

Also moved CB1 to be closer to vreg, and repositioned CB2 to be closer to ESP. Although optional, these bulk caps may be needed for stabilization.

Rev 12: 
Changed Q1 to MMBT3904 in SOT23
Changed Q3 to MMBT3906 in SOT23
Added D10, a 12v zener diode to limit Loconet Master current source voltage. May change to a 13v zener to allow a little more margin.
Changed D3 and D5 to SMD instead of THT.
