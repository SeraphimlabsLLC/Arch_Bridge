
Rev 06:
Decreased F2 250mA fuse, making it same as F1.
R9 is now 33 ohm 2w, voltage drops below 7v triggering limiting/disconnect before F2 blows.
Previous design would have blown fuse above 12v before railsync devices disconnected. 

Relabel TTY to CONSOLE. 
Changed pinout to match Crystal board: +5v, TX, RX, GND. 
Added status LED on TX. 

Relabel I2C to COM2. 
Changed pinout: +5v, TX, RX, GND.
Added status LED on TX. 
Connected OE to processor OE output. 

PCB revisions to incorporate these changes.
