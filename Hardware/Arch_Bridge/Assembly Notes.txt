Could decrease R9 from 5w to 3w if staying at 500mA fuse, since it would never see more than 2.5W.


Q2 badly underperforming, HFE showing as only 11 when datasheet minimum says 20.
Load is only 114mW, perhaps switch to a 2N2907?
Alternatively, R10 to 270 ohms and R11 to 4.7kohm   Yaego RC1206FR-10270RL and RC1206FR-104K7L
